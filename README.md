# Chromatic
#### Back to the Future: In Color!

Chromatic takes the current time from anywhere in the world, translates it into a color, and displays that color in real time. Includes an Apple Watch companion app too!*

Translated and modified from Ian Keen's implementation in Objective-C (https://github.com/IanKeen/WhatColourIsIt)

#### Libraries used:

* Google Places
* Google Geocoding API
* Google Time Zone API
* [Google Places Field](https://github.com/IanKeen/GooglePlacesField)

#### Requirements:
You will need to provide a plist file that includes your Google API key, your IAP ID's for two items, and your personal URL's for Twitter/GitHub. Otherwise simply remove these pieces from the codebase before building.
