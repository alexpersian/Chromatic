# Chromatic
Back to the Future: In Color!

Chromatic takes the current time from anywhere in the world, translates it into a color, and displays that color in real time. Includes an Apple Watch companion app too!

Translated and modified from Ian Keen's implementation in Objective-C (https://github.com/IanKeen/WhatColourIsIt)

Uses:

* Google Places
* Google Geocoding API
* Google Time Zone API
* [Google Places Field](https://github.com/IanKeen/GooglePlacesField)
